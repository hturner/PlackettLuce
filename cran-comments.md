## Comments

This submission builds on the functionality for Plackett-Luce regression models.

The CRAN checks have two issues:

1. Note regarding imports from R6 - fixed.
2. Warning on r-release-macos-arm64 - could not reproduce, but vignette modified to avoid warning.  

## Test environments

1. (Local) Windows 10
2. (Local) Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS, R 4.1.1
3. (Win-builder) Windows Server 2008 (64-bit), R-devel (2021-08-09 r80724)

### Check results

Checks return a note regarding URLs/DOIs. This is a false alarm: all the links redirect to valid pages on jstor.org or projecteuclid.org.
