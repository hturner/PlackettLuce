abstract = {Rapid climatic and socio-economic changes challenge current agricultural R{\&}D capacity. The necessary quantum leap in knowledge generation should build on the innovation capacity of farmers themselves. A novel citizen science methodology, triadic comparisons of technologies or tricot , was implemented in pilot studies in India, East Africa, and Central America. The methodology involves distributing a pool of agricultural technologies in different combinations of three to individual farmers who observe these technologies under farm conditions and compare their performance. Since the combinations of three technologies overlap, statistical methods can piece together the overall performance ranking of the complete pool of technologies. The tricot approach affords wide scaling, as the distribution of trial packages and instruction sessions is relatively easy to execute, farmers do not need to be organized in collaborative groups, and feedback is easy to collect, even by phone. The tricot approach provides interpretable, meaningful results and was widely accepted by farmers. The methodology underwent improvement in data input formats. A number of methodological issues remain: integrating environmental analysis, capturing gender-specific differences, stimulating farmers' motivation, and supporting implementation with an integrated digital platform. Future studies should apply the tricot approach to a wider range of technologies, quantify its potential contribution to climate adaptation, and embed the approach in appropriate institutions and business models, empowering participants and democratizing science.},

abstract = {The multinomial-Poisson (MP) transformation simplifies maximum likelihood estimation in a wide variety of models for multinomial data. On the basis of specialized derivations, investigators have applied the MP transformation to various models. Here we present a general derivation, which is simpler than the specialized derivations and allows investigators to use the MP transformation readily in new models. We also show how the MP transformation can accommodate incomplete multinomial data and how it can assist in finding closed form maximum likelihood estimates and variances. Previous applications include log-linear models, capture-recapture models, proportional hazards models with categorical covariates and generalizations of the Rasch model. New applications include computing the variance of the logarithm of the odds ratio, a model for voter plurality, conditional logistic regression for matched sets and two-stage case-control studies.$\backslash$n},

abstract = {The preference scaling of a group of subjects may not be homogeneous, but different groups of subjects with certain characteristics may show different preference scalings, each of which can be derived from paired comparisons by means of the Bradley-Terry model. Usually, either different models are fit in predefined subsets of the sample or the effects of subject covariates are explicitly specified in a parametric model. In both cases, categorical covariates can be employed directly to distinguish between the different groups, while numeric covariates are typically discretized prior to modeling. Here, a semiparametric approach for recursive partitioning of Bradley-Terry models is introduced as a means for identifying groups of subjects with homogeneous preference scalings in a data-driven way. In this approach, the covariates that—in main effects or interactions—distinguish between groups of subjects with different preference orderings, are detected automatically from the set of candidate covariates.

@article{Luce1977,
abstract = {This survey is divided into three major sections. The first concerns mathematical results about the choice axiom and the choice models that devoIve from it. For example, its relationship to Thurstonian theory is satisfyingly understood; much is known about how choice and ranking probabilities may relate, although little of this knowledge seems empirically useful; and there are certain interesting statistical facts. The second section describes attempts that have been made to test and apply these models. The testing has been done mostly, though not exclusively, by psychologists; the applications have been mostly in economics and sociology. Although it is clear from many experiments that the conditions under which the choice axiom holds are surely delicate, the need for simple, rational underpinnings in complex theories, as in economics and sociology, leads one to accept assumptions that are at best approximate. And the third section concerns alternative, more general theories which, in spirit, are much like the choice axiom. Perhaps I had best admit at the outset that, as a commentator on this scene, I am qualified no better than many others and rather less well than some who have been working in this area recently, which I have not been. My pursuits have led me along other, somewhat related routes. On the one hand, I have contributed to some of the recent, purely algebraic aspects of fundamental measurement (for a survey of some of this material, see Krantz, Lute, Suppes, {\&} Tversky, 1971). And on the other hand, I have worked in the highly probabilistic area of psychophysical theory; but the empirical materials have led me away from axiomatic structures, such as the choice axiom, to more structural, neural models which are not readily axiomatized at the present time. After some attempts to apply choice models to psychophysical phenomena (discussed below in its proper place), I was led to conclude that it is not a very promising approach to, these data, and so I have not been actively studying any aspect of the choice axiom in over 12 years. With that understood, let us begin.},

@article{Hunter2004,
abstract = {The Bradley-Terry model for paired comparisons is a simple and muchstudied means to describe the probabilities of the possible outcomes when individuals are judged against one another in pairs. Among the many studies of the model in the past 75 years, numerous authors have generalized it in several directions, sometimes providing iterative algorithms for obtaining maximum likelihood estimates for the generalizations. Building on a theory of algorithms known by the initials MM, for minorization-maximization, this paper presents a powerful technique for producing iterative maximum likelihood estimation algorithms for a wide class of generalizations of the Bradley-Terry model. While algorithms for problems of this type have tended to be custom-built in the literature, the techniques in this paper enable their mass production. Simple conditions are stated that guarantee that each algorithm described will produce a sequence that converges to the unique maximum likelihood estimator. Several of the algorithms and convergence results herein are new.},

abstract = {This study is concerned with the extension of the Bradley-Terry model for paired comparisons to situations which allow an expression of no preference. A new model is developed and its performance compared with a model proposed by Rao and Kupper. The maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters are found using an iterative procedure which, under a weak assumption, converges monotonically to the solution of the likelihood equations. It is noted that for a balanced paired comparison experiment the ranking obtained from the maximum likelihood estimates agrees with that obtained from a scoring system which allots two points for a win, one for a tie and zero for a loss. The likelihood ratio test of the hypothesis of equal preferences is shown to have the same asymptotic efficiency as that for the Rao-Kupper model. Two examples are presented, one of which introduces a set of data for an unbalanced paired comparison experiment. Initial applications of the test of goodness of fit suggest that the proposed model ...},

abstract = {Ranking data represent a peculiar form of multivariate ordinal data taking values in the set of permutations. Despite the numerous methodological contributions to increase the flexibility of ranked data modeling, the application of more sophisticated models is limited by the related computational issues. The PLMIX package offers a comprehensive framework aimed at endowing the R statistical environment with some recent methodological advances on model-based analysis of partially ranked data. The usefulness of the novel PLMIX package can be motivated from several perspectives: (i) it contributes to fill the gap concerning Bayesian estimation of ranking models in R, by focusing on the Plackett-Luce model and its extension within the finite mixture approach as the generative sampling distribution; (ii) it addresses computational complexity by combining the flexibility of R routines and the speed of compiled C code, with possible parallel execution; (iii) it covers the fundamental phases of ranking data analysis allowing for a more careful and critical application of ranking models in real experiments; (iv) it provides effective tools for clustering heterogeneous partially ranked data. The functionality of the novel package is illustrated with several applications to simulated and real datasets.},
